# Data Editor for Mainframe

The Data Editor for Mainframe Code4z extension adds a modern user interface to [File Master Plus for MVS](https://www.broadcom.com/products/mainframe/testing-and-quality/file-master-plus). The Data Editor for Mainframe extension enables engineers to view and edit test data directly in VS Code without needing to submit jobs or use the traditional 3270 green screen interface. Data Editor for Mainframe includes the following features:

- Browse and edit VSAM data sets, sequential data sets and PDS members.
- Apply layouts to view data set records in single-record format.
- Interactively filter records using selection criteria.
